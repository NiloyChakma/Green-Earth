## Difference between var, let and const:
### var is a variable that can be declared outside of any function.
### let is block-scoped variable. It can be changed through in the scope where it is declared.
### const is block-scoped constant. Once it is declared in the scope, it can't be changed later.
## Difference between map(), forEach() and filter():
### map() creates new array and returns it.
### forEach() doesn't return anything, else it modifies or reads the data.
### filter() creates a new array from an existing array with conditions.
## Arrow functions in ES6:
### Instead of writing functions details, we use short and concise form of function, it's called array functions. As example:- const square = (x) => x*x;
## Working of destructuring assignment in ES6:
### By destructing assignment, we can access any values from array or object with any new declared variables.
## Template literals in ES6:
### It allows to use embedded expressions with strings. In traditional string concatenation, it is not possible to use embedded expressions along with strings. There are needed extra '' to add these. Which is solved by template literals.
